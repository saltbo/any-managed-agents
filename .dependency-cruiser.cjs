/**
 * Architecture enforcement for the hono-cf-clean-arch layout.
 *   pnpm lint:arch  →  depcruise server/ shared/ --config .dependency-cruiser.cjs
 *
 * The clean core is domain/ → usecases/ → adapters/ ← http/. Those rules are
 * strict. After the clean-arch endgame the drizzle rule has exactly two named
 * exceptions:
 *   - server/auth        OIDC/session auth module: owns its tables, is the auth
 *                        wall, spans layers by design (the skill's accepted
 *                        auth-module exception).
 *   - server/http/e2e.ts e2e test fixture (gated by AMA_E2E_TEST_AUTH): reads
 *                        raw persisted vault rows incl. ciphertext for
 *                        encryption-at-rest scenarios — storage-level inspection
 *                        is its whole purpose, so it holds drizzle rather than
 *                        polluting the VaultRepo port with a test-only method.
 *
 * Everything else is drizzle-free: composition.ts wires the db via db/client,
 * audit.ts delegates to adapters/repos/audit-write, and app.ts is a pure
 * assembler. The runtime is folded into domain/usecases/adapters/http under the
 * standard clean-arch rules; the only named cross-layer modules are the Durable
 * Objects under server/worker/ and runtime-core/.
