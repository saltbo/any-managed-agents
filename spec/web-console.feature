Feature: Web console
  A Cloudflare-native web console operates the control plane: a stable app shell
  with organization and project context, resource lists and detail pages for every
  capability, destructive-action confirmations, and a single shared Hono RPC client
  for all control-plane calls.

  # ── App shell and navigation (web: jsdom) ──

  @web-console/shell @web
  Scenario: Render the application shell and primary navigation
    Given a signed-in user has access to a project
    When the user opens the console
    Then the sidebar shows agents, environments, sessions, providers, vaults, MCP, usage, audit, and settings
    And the current organization and project context are visible

  @web-console/routed-pages @web
  Scenario: Navigate routed resource and detail pages
    Given a project has agents, environments, sessions, providers, vaults, MCP connectors, usage, and audit records
    When the user navigates the console and opens detail pages
    Then each resource list and its detail page render from the control-plane responses
    And raw secret values are never rendered in detail pages

  # ── Resource list rendering (web: list rows and errors) ──

  @web-console/resource-lists @web
  Scenario: Render resource list rows with paginated, tooltip-backed status
    Given providers and MCP connections include error and disabled status
    When the user opens the provider and MCP lists
    Then each row renders on one line with pagination counts
    And error and disabled detail is exposed through tooltips instead of inline overflow

  # ── Destructive operations (web: confirm + audit) ──

  @web-console/destructive-ops @web
  Scenario: Confirm destructive actions through the shared dialog
    Given a session can be stopped and archived
    When the user triggers a stop or archive from the console
    Then a confirmation dialog names the resource and consequence before the action runs
    And archived resources expose no further destructive action

  # ── Shared API client (web: single Hono RPC client) ──

  @web-console/rpc-client @web
  Scenario: Use one shared Hono RPC client for control-plane calls
    Given the console issues a control-plane list request
    When the request is sent
    Then it uses the shared authenticated client with bearer auth, tenancy headers, the web-rpc marker, and serialized list options
    And external automation remains described by the OpenAPI document
