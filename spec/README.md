# Product specs (BDD-lite)

Behaviour-first product specs in Gherkin `.feature` files. This directory is the
**single source of truth for `.feature` files** and for **what the product does**,
independent of implementation. The `.feature` files are documentation: tests trace
back to scenarios by id, the spec does not generate tests.

## Convention

- **One `.feature` file per capability** (`agents.feature`, `sessions.feature`,
  `auth.feature`, …). Merge or split the old per-resource files into the capability
  they belong to.
- Each scenario carries exactly **two tags**: the stable **id** `@<capability>/<slug>`
  and the single **layer** that proves it — `@domain` / `@usecase` / `@web` / `@api` /
  `@e2e`:

  ```gherkin
  @agents/create @usecase
  Scenario: Create an agent definition
    Given a signed-in user with access to a project
    When the user creates an agent with instructions, provider, model, and tools
    Then the agent is stored with a current version and project scope
  ```

- The id **never changes** once written (rename = new id). Ids are trivially
  greppable — a cleaner mechanism than embedding ids in prose.
- Pick the **cheapest layer that can prove it**. Old `@api` scenarios usually become
  `@api` (assembled-server contract) or `@usecase` (business branch); old `@ui`
  scenarios usually become `@web` (jsdom) or `@e2e` (real browser journey). Reserve
  `@e2e` for genuinely cross-stack, hermetic journeys. BDD-lite must not turn every
  scenario into a slow E2E.
- The old `@implemented` / `@planned` noise tags are gone. A scenario lives here
  because it is the product's intended behaviour; the `[spec: id]` breadcrumb (below)
  records whether and where it is proven.

Keep this directory **pure**: only `.feature` files and this README. No test code,
no step definitions, no runner config.

## Traceability

Each scenario's home test carries `[spec: <id>]` in its `describe`/`it` name, so a
scenario traces to the test that proves it (and back). The home test lives at the
layer named by the scenario's layer tag:

| layer tag   | home location                                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@domain`   | `server/domain/*.test.ts`                                |
| `@usecase`  | `server/usecases/*.test.ts`                              |
| `@api`      | `server/http/*.test.ts` (workers pool + real D1)         |
| `@web`      | `src/**/*.test.ts(x)` (jsdom + vi-mocked api)            |
| `@e2e`      | `e2e/*.spec.ts` (native Playwright, real stack)          |

```ts
describe('[spec: agents/create] createAgent', () => { … })
```

`pnpm lint:spec` (a governance lint, sibling to `lint:arch`) parses every
`@<capability>/<slug>` id in `spec/*.feature` and fails if a covered capability has a
scenario id with no `[spec: …]` breadcrumb anywhere in the test tree. See
**Enforcement scope** below — it is not a behavioural test and lives only as a script.

## Runner decision (no Cucumber)

Per the skill, `.feature` files under `spec/` are documentation with **no Cucumber
runner** — Cucumber has been removed entirely (no `@cucumber/cucumber`, no step
definitions):

- `spec/` is the **only** home for `.feature` files, and nothing executes the Gherkin.
  Most scenarios are proven at the cheapest layer (`@domain`/`@usecase`/`@api`/`@web`)
  by ordinary vitest tests carrying `[spec: id]` breadcrumbs.
- The cross-stack crown is **native Playwright** in `e2e/*.spec.ts` (`pnpm e2e`,
  booted by `pnpm e2e:server`). Scenarios tagged **`@e2e`** are the genuinely
  cross-stack, hermetic journeys — reimplemented as Playwright specs that carry the
  matching `[spec: id]`, executed for real instead of merely traced.
- The old `specs/product/`, `specs/smoke/`, and the Cucumber step files were deleted;
  their behaviour lives on as capability specs plus the layered tests that carry the
  breadcrumbs.

**Escalation path:** if a non-technical audience ever needs to *run* more of the
Gherkin, wire [`playwright-bdd`](https://github.com/vitalets/playwright-bdd) (compiles
`.feature` → Playwright). These are already real `.feature` files, so that step is
mechanical — do not reach for raw `@cucumber/cucumber`, and do not adopt it
preemptively.

## Enforcement scope

`lint:spec` enforces breadcrumb coverage **only for capabilities that have opted in**
— a capability is enforced once it appears in the `ENFORCED_CAPABILITIES` allowlist in
`scripts/check-spec-coverage.ts`. The seed capabilities are **agents, sessions,
auth**. As each remaining capability is migrated into `spec/` with breadcrumbs, add it
to the allowlist. This keeps the lint from false-failing on capabilities whose specs
exist but whose breadcrumbs are still being fanned out.
