Feature: Projects
  A project is the tenant scope for every AMA resource. External products such as
  Agent Kanban own their own workflow but use AMA as the lower-level agent,
  environment, session, runner, and event substrate through the OpenAPI SDK —
  storing only standard AMA fields and keeping product mappings in their own store.

  # ── Project lifecycle (usecase: tenant scope, default project) ──

  @projects/lifecycle @usecase
  Scenario: Materialize and create projects in the caller organization
    Given a caller signs in to an organization
    When the caller lists projects on a first empty page or creates a project
    Then a default project is lazily created on the first empty page only
    And an explicitly created project is inserted in the caller organization

  # ── External product as substrate (e2e: real SDK + Worker + D1) ──
  # Native Playwright e2e specs execute these scenarios for real through `pnpm run e2e`.

  @projects/external-resources @e2e
  Scenario: External product manages standard AMA resources through the SDK
    Given an external product owns its workflow identifiers and product state
    When the product creates or updates AMA agent definitions, environments, and resources through the OpenAPI SDK
    Then AMA stores only standard AMA resource fields
    And AMA does not store product-specific external references as first-class fields
    And the product keeps any mapping between product records and AMA ids in its own storage
    And AMA does not require the product to expose board, task, review, or PR concepts

  @projects/external-session @e2e
  Scenario: External product starts work by creating an AMA session
    Given an external product has selected a standard AMA agent definition
    And the external product has selected a standard AMA environment
    And the external product has selected standard AMA resource references
    When the external product creates an AMA session through the OpenAPI SDK
    Then AMA snapshots the selected agent and environment
    And AMA validates the session runtime, provider, and model before runtime work starts
    And AMA returns a stable session id, status, status reason, runtime, and event endpoint
    And the external product can store the returned AMA ids in its own product records
    And the external product can render progress from AMA session status and canonical events

  @projects/external-control @e2e
  Scenario: External product controls a running session only through AMA endpoints
    Given an external product created an AMA session
    When the external product sends a follow-up message, stop request, or resume request
    Then AMA routes the command to the selected runtime or owning self-hosted runner
    And AMA records the command result as canonical session events
    And the external product never connects to a sandbox-local, runner-local, or official-runtime-local endpoint
